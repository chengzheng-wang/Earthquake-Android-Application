This is an android application to show latest earthquake information from the world. The data is fetched by the API from USGS:
https://www.usgs.gov/
The user could set the preference such as: whether the data is order by time or by the magnitude; what is the minimum magnitude to show and how much earth quake information the user wants to reach.
The app will show the magnitude, the address and the date of a certain earthquake. By clicking it, it will redirect to the USGS website for more information.
